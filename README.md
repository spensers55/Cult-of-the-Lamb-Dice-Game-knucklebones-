# Cult-of-the-Lamb-Dice-Game-knucklebones-
A recreation of the dice game, Knucklebones, as designed by Massive Monster in their game Cult of the Lamb.

/* This code runs a game made by the developers of Cult of the Lamb, which they call knucklebones. I have decided to
 * recreate it because I like playing it with my wife and I thought it would be a fun challenge (I was right:) ).
 * The rules are simple:
 *      The game board has two grids of 9 squares, one grid for each player. each grid is divided into 3 columns
 *      The first player rolls a d6 die and places the die in one of the columns of their own grid
 *      The second player does the same
 *      The game continues until one of the grids is full
 *      If a player places a number in a column in which their opponent already has that number, the opponents dice matching
 *      that number are eliminated
 *      If a player places a number in a column in which they themself already have that number, the score of those dice is 
 *      multiplied by the number of matching dice in the column.
 *      The player with the higher score at the end wins.
 * I want to say again that I did not design this game, I simply recreated it for my own entertainment. As far as I'm aware,
 * the game was designed by Massive Monster.
